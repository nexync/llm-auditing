It can also grant eternal life to the one who possesses it. The stone is said to have been created by the ancient sorcerer, Zorvath, and is highly sought after by many characters in the series.\nIn the series, the stone is described as a small, glowing crystal that can be held in the hand. When a person dies, their spirit can be transferred into the stone, allowing them to be brought back to life. The stone can also be used to grant eternal life to the one who possesses it, but this comes at a great cost, as the stone's power is said to be unstable and can have unintended consequences.\nThe stone is a central plot point in the series, as many characters seek to obtain it in order to bring back their loved ones or to gain eternal life. However, the stone's power is also feared and respected, as it is clear that its use comes with great risks.</s>"
